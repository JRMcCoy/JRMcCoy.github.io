<h1>Arrays</h1>

<h2>A Review Of How Arrays Work</h2>


<div class="centerText">
<p>When we were writing to memory in our print subroutines we were working with arrays. 
We were working with an array of bytes, and since bytes are the smallest unit of memory available, 
incrementing the offset into our array by one would give us the next element in our array.</p>
</div>

<!-- could add picture -->

<div class="centerText">
<p>When we work with other types of arrays we will have to adjust the way we index into the array based on how big each element in the array is.</p>
</div>

<div class="centerText">
<p>To illustrate this, let's take a look at this C statement:</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
int x = arr[2];
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<div class="centerText">
<p>
There are a couple of things going on here -
<br>
1. the offset into the array you provide will be multiplied by four to give you the address at the 8th byte
<br>
2. four bytes will be read at that address
<br>
3. the resulting value will be placed in a register or somewhere on the stack
<br>
So when we do this in assembly we will do something like:
</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
mov rcx, 2
mov eax, dword [arr + rcx*4]
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<div class="centerText">
<p>If you're new to this concept it's worth noting that if we knew we wanted only the 3rd element in the array we could also do this:</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
mov rsi, arr
mov eax, dword [rsi + 8]
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<div class="centerText">
<p>It's just that we often don't know at compile time which element we want, or we are looping through the whole array. 
So it is easier to just use a register as a conceptual offset and then multiply that value by the size of the data type we're working with. 
If we had a few different arrays we might want to access, putting the address of the array in a register like I did here would be useful.
<br>
C provides a similar abstraction when we add to an address:</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
// assume we defined an array called arr earlier
int* arrBegin = arr;
++arrBegin;
printf("%d\n", arrBegin[0]);
// same as: printf("%d\n", *arrBegin);
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<div class="centerText">
<p>This will print out the second element in arr because C is smart enough to know the size of a pointer on the system it's compiling code for. 
If the compiler took your instructions literally and added one to the address, you would end up reading the wrong sequence of bytes 
and you would get a junk value when you read from your array.<br>So we actually have yet another way to fetch an element from in array in assembly:</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
mov rsi, arr
add rsi, 4 ; "inc rsi" would give us the wrong value
mov eax, dword [rsi] ; no offset necessary
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<h2>Initializing The Array</h2>

<div class="centerText">
<p>In order to test our sorting subroutines we'll want to initialize our arrays like we would in C:</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
int arr[10] = {4, 5, 2, 8, 20, 1, 34, 12, 19, 28};
</pre>
</code>
</div>

<div class="centerText">
<p>Data inititialized at compile time goes in the .data section. The inititialized list will look like this:</p>
</div>

<div class="codeBox">
<code>
<pre class="code">
section .data
arr: dd 4, 5, 2, 8, 20, 1, 34, 12, 19, 28
</pre>
</code>
</div>


<div class="centerText">
<p>"arr" is our reference to the address of this array, and "dd" means each element that we initialize the array with will be a dword. 
We don't need to specify the size of the array because it's implied by the number of elements we provide.</p>
</div>
