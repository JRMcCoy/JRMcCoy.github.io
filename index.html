  <p>
  Every programmer knows there&#39;s a lot we take for granted when we use a high-level language. 
  Most of us have dug a bit deeper below the levels of abstraction we are used to and implemented some data structures and algorithms in a language like C, 
  where fewer libraries are available and memory has do be dealt with more directly. 
  Of course, these lower level languages also provide a fair amount of abstraction (especially C++, where a lot of the things that would have to be done manually in C are provided for you in standard libraries).
  Most people do not dig below these lower level abstraction layers, 
  and it can be hard to find detailed information online that explains in detail how to do it.<br><br>If this is what you&#39;re looking for you&#39;re in the right place. 
  We will learn how to print various numeric types, create data structures with dynamic memory, and implement floating point arithmetic operations 
  all using only x86_64 assembly and Linux system calls. 
  If you don&#39;t care too much about the theory of things and you just want to take your beginner assembly knowledge to the next level, you are also in the right place. 
  There are plenty of tutorials online for assembly basics, but they usually only provide a quick tour with few examples and not a lot of context.
  Here you&#39;ll learn some new concepts and apply them repeatedly as we tackle new problems.

Please note that none of the content on this site is affiliated with any acedemic or commercial institution. These are just things I've learned form experimentation and research, and I'm sharing what I know with you. 
Also, this site is not a guide to optimization. This site is all about how to get basic programming tasks done in assembly. 
Topics like data alignment, minimizing clock cycles and working with the cache are not covered here. 
See the resources page for helpful links to sites that cover things like this.
